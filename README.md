# Stats + Prob functions
Use _source("My Functions.R")_ to bring these functions into your global environment
A bunch of functions I made for my introuduction to statistics and probability course including:
- permutations + cobinations, with and without replacement
- probability mass function, Bernoulli trials, binomial distribution, geometric dist., poisson dist.
- linear regression model (get formula of the line printed out etc.)
- z-score, p-value, chi-square test for independence


Source of z-score and p-value as proper functions

- idk why these aren't built in?
